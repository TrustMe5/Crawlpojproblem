2D-Nim,http://poj.org/problem?id=1021, 1000MS, 10000K,"The 2D-Nim board game is played on a grid, with pieces on the grid points. On each move, a player may remove any positive number of contiguous pieces in any row or column. The player who removes the last piece wins. For example, consider the left grid in the following figure.The player on move may remove (A), (B), (A, B), (A, B, C), or (B,F), etc., but may not remove (A, C), (D, E), (H, I) or (B, G).For purposes of writing 2D-Nim-playing software, a certain programmer wants to be able to tell whether or not a certain position has ever been analyzed previously. Because of the rules of 2D-Nim, it should be clear that the two boards above are essentially equivalent. That is, if there is a winning strategy for the left board, the same one must apply to the right board. The fact that the contiguous groups of pieces appear in different places and orientations is clearly irrelevant. All that matters is that the same clusters of pieces (a cluster being a set of contiguous pieces that can be reached from each other by a sequence of one-square vertical or horizontal moves) appear in each. For example, the cluster of pieces (A, B, C, F, G) appears on both boards, but it has been reflected (swapping left and right), rotated, and moved.

Numbers That Count,http://poj.org/problem?id=1016, 1000MS, 10000K,"""Kronecker's Knumbers"" is a little company that manufactures plastic digits for use in signs (theater marquees, gas station price displays, and so on). The owner and sole employee, Klyde Kronecker, keeps track of how many digits of each type he has used by maintaining an inventory book. For instance, if he has just made a sign containing the telephone number ""5553141"", he'll write down the number ""5553141"" in one column of his book, and in the next column he'll list how many of each digit he used: two 1s, one 3, one 4, and three 5s. (Digits that don't get used don't appear in the inventory.) He writes the inventory in condensed form, like this: ""21131435"". The other day, Klyde filled an order for the number 31123314 and was amazed to discover that the inventory of this number is the same as the number---it has three 1s, one 2, three 3s, and one 4! He calls this an example of a ""self-inventorying number"", and now he wants to find out which numbers are self-inventorying, or lead to a self-inventorying number through iterated application of the inventorying operation described below. You have been hired to help him in his investigations. Given any non-negative integer n, its inventory is another integer consisting of a concatenation of integers c1 d1 c2 d2 ... ck dk , where each ci and di is an unsigned integer, every ci is positive, the di satisfy 0<=d1<d2<...<dk<=9, and, for each digit d that appears anywhere in n, d equals di for some i and d occurs exactly ci times in the decimal representation of n. For instance, to compute the inventory of 5553141 we set c1 = 2, d1 = 1, c2 = 1, d2 = 3, etc., giving 21131435. The number 1000000000000 has inventory 12011 (""twelve 0s, one 1""). An integer n is called self-inventorying if n equals its inventory. It is called self-inventorying after j steps (j>=1) if j is the smallest number such that the value of the j-th iterative application of the inventory function is self-inventorying. For instance, 21221314 is self-inventorying after 2 steps, since the inventory of 21221314 is 31321314, the inventory of 31321314 is 31123314, and 31123314 is self-inventorying. Finally, n enters an inventory loop of length k (k>=2) if k is the smallest number such that for some integer j (j>=0), the value of the j-th iterative application of the inventory function is the same as the value of the (j + k)-th iterative application. For instance, 314213241519 enters an inventory loop of length 2, since the inventory of 314213241519 is 412223241519 and the inventory of 412223241519 is 314213241519, the original number (we have j = 0 in this case). Write a program that will read a sequence of non-negative integers and, for each input value, state whether it is self-inventorying, self-inventorying after j steps, enters an inventory loop of length k, or has none of these properties after 15 iterative applications of the inventory function. ","A sequence of non-negative integers, each having at most 80 digits, followed by the terminating value -1. There are no extra leading zeros. ","For each non-negative input value n, output the appropriate choice from among the following messages (where n is the input value, j is a positive integer, and k is a positive integer greater than 1): n is self-inventorying n is self-inventorying after j steps n enters an inventory loop of length k n can not be classified after 15 iterations ","22

Jury Compromise,http://poj.org/problem?id=1015, 1000MS, 65536K,"In Frobnia, a far-away country, the verdicts in court trials are determined by a jury consisting of members of the general public. Every time a trial is set to begin, a jury has to be selected, which is done as follows. First, several people are drawn randomly from the public. For each person in this pool, defence and prosecution assign a grade from 0 to 20 indicating their preference for this person. 0 means total dislike, 20 on the other hand means that this person is considered ideally suited for the jury. Based on the grades of the two parties, the judge selects the jury. In order to ensure a fair trial, the tendencies of the jury to favour either defence or prosecution should be as balanced as possible. The jury therefore has to be chosen in a way that is satisfactory to both parties. We will now make this more precise: given a pool of n potential jurors and two values di (the defence's value) and pi (the prosecution's value) for each potential juror i, you are to select a jury of m persons. If J is a subset of {1,..., n} with m elements, then D(J ) = sum(dk)  k belong to Jand P(J) = sum(pk) k belong to J are the total values of this jury for defence and prosecution. For an optimal jury J , the value |D(J) - P(J)| must be minimal. If there are several jurys with minimal |D(J) - P(J)|, one which maximizes D(J) + P(J) should be selected since the jury should be as ideal as possible for both parties. You are to write a program that implements this jury selection process and chooses an optimal jury given a set of candidates. ","The input file contains several jury selection rounds. Each round starts with a line containing two integers n and m. n is the number of candidates and m the number of jury members. These values will satisfy 1The file ends with a round that has n = m = 0.

Now if Sally weighs one of the true coins against a third coin and the scales do not balance then Sally knows the third coin is counterfeit and she can tell whether it is light or heavy depending on whether the balance on which it is placed goes up or down, respectively. By choosing her weighings carefully, Sally is able to ensure that she will find the counterfeit coin with exactly three weighings.

Maya Calendar,http://poj.org/problem?id=1008, 1000MS, 10000K,"During his last sabbatical, professor M. A. Ya made a surprising discovery about the old Maya calendar. From an old knotted message, professor discovered that the Maya civilization used a 365 day long year, called Haab, which had 19 months. Each of the first 18 months was 20 days long, and the names of the months were pop, no, zip, zotz, tzec, xul, yoxkin, mol, chen, yax, zac, ceh, mac, kankin, muan, pax, koyab, cumhu. Instead of having names, the days of the months were denoted by numbers starting from 0 to 19. The last month of Haab was called uayet and had 5 days denoted by numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. The Maya believed that this month was unlucky, the court of justice was not in session, the trade stopped, people did not even sweep the floor. For religious purposes, the Maya used another calendar in which the year was called Tzolkin (holly year). The year was divided into thirteen periods, each 20 days long. Each day was denoted by a pair consisting of a number and the name of the day. They used 20 names: imix, ik, akbal, kan, chicchan, cimi, manik, lamat, muluk, ok, chuen, eb, ben, ix, mem, cib, caban, eznab, canac, ahau and 13 numbers; both in cycles. Notice that each day has an unambiguous description. For example, at the beginning of the year the days were described as follows: 1 imix, 2 ik, 3 akbal, 4 kan, 5 chicchan, 6 cimi, 7 manik, 8 lamat, 9 muluk, 10 ok, 11 chuen, 12 eb, 13 ben, 1 ix, 2 mem, 3 cib, 4 caban, 5 eznab, 6 canac, 7 ahau, and again in the next period 8 imix, 9 ik, 10 akbal . . .Years (both Haab and Tzolkin) were denoted by numbers 0, 1, : : : , where the number 0 was the beginning of the world. Thus, the first day was: Haab: 0. pop 0 Tzolkin: 1 imix 0 Help professor M. A. Ya and write a program for him to convert the dates from the Haab calendar to the Tzolkin calendar. ","The date in Haab is given in the following format:NumberOfTheDay. Month YearThe first line of the input file contains the number of the input dates in the file. The next n lines contain n dates in the Haab calendar format, each in separate line. The year is smaller then 5000. ","The date in Tzolkin should be in the following format:Number NameOfTheDay YearThe first line of the output file contains the number of the output dates.

DNA Sorting,http://poj.org/problem?id=1007, 1000MS, 10000K,"One measure of ``unsortedness'' in a sequence is the number of pairs of entries that are out of order with respect to each other. For instance, in the letter sequence ``DAABEC'', this measure is 5, since D is greater than four letters to its right and E is greater than one letter to its right. This measure is called the number of inversions in the sequence. The sequence ``AACEDGG'' has only one inversion (E and D)---it is nearly sorted---while the sequence ``ZWQM'' has 6 inversions (it is as unsorted as can be---exactly the reverse of sorted).You are responsible for cataloguing a sequence of DNA strings (sequences containing only the four letters A, C, G, and T).

Square Ice,http://poj.org/problem?id=1099, 1000MS, 10000K,"Square Ice is a two-dimensional arrangement of water molecules H2O, with oxygen at the vertices of a square lattice and one hydrogen atom between each pair of adjacent oxygen atoms. The hydrogen atoms must stick out on the left and right sides but are not allowed to stick out the top or bottom. One 5 x 5 example is shown below. Note that each hydrogen atom is attached to exactly one of its neighboring oxygen atoms and each oxygen atom is attached to two of its neighboring hydrogen atoms. (Recall that one water molecule is a unit of one O linked to two H's.)It turns out we can encode a square ice pattern with what is known as an alternating sign matrix (ASM): horizontal molecules are encoded as 1, vertical molecules are encoded as -1 and all other molecules are encoded as 0. So, the above pattern would be encoded as:An ASM is a square matrix with entries 0, 1 and -1, where the sum of each row and column is 1 and the non-zero entries in each row and in each column must alternate in sign. (It turns out there is a one-to-one correspondence between ASM's and square ice patterns!)Your job is to display the square ice pattern, in the same format as the example above, for a given ASM. Use dashes (-) for horizontal attachments and vertical bars (|) for vertical attachments.

Robots,http://poj.org/problem?id=1098, 1000MS, 10000K,"The Robots game is a one-player game played on a 31 x 31 board. The board is partitioned into 1 x 1 cells arranged in 31 rows and 31 columns. Each cell is indexed by (r, c) where r is the row and c is the column (starting from 1), and it may be empty, occupied by you, occupied by a robot, or occupied by debris. The object of this game is to move in such a way to destroy all the robots before the robots destroy you. Initially, you occupy the cell at (15, 15), and there are R robots (1 When the robots move, each robot walks to the adjacent cell (even if it is not empty) in the eight compass directions such that the destination cell is closest to your current position (i.e. after your last move). The distance between two cells (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) is defined to be | r1 - r2 | + | c1 - c2 |. All robots walk at the same time during a move. If two or more robots walk to the same cell, or if a robot walks to a cell containing debris, all of these robots are destroyed. Destroyed robots become debris.You lose the game if any robot walks to your current position, even if multiple robots do so and destroy each other. You win the game if all robots are destroyed and none has moved to your current position.In order to stay in the game as long as possible, you will only consider moves that do not lead to an immediate loss (a loss before your next move). A plausible strategy is to always walk to a cell (or remain stationary) such that the number of robots remaining after your move and the robots' move (i.e. just before your next move) is minimized. In case of a tie, choose the move that maximizes the minimum distance to the remaining robots just before your next move. If there are still ties, choose the move that also minimizes the row index of the destination cell, and finally, break remaining ties by also minimizing the column index.If it is not possible to make a move by walking or by remaining stationary without leading to an immediate loss, you should teleport to the first unused legal destination chosen from a list of locations given to you, as long as it does not lead to an immediate loss. When you search for a teleport site, you should always start the search at the beginning of the list. If no such teleport destination is available, you should remain stationary, leading to an immediate loss.In this problem, you will implement this strategy and see how well it works.","The input consists of a number of instances.

Myles is given a layout of the highway system and a set of locations where the signs should go: he is in charge of determining the mileage to nearby cities. To select which cities should be listed on any sign, he uses the following strategy: City X is put on the sign if the sign is on a road such that the shortest path from the intersection immediately preceding the sign to X uses the road.

Since the station will occasionally fly through the upper atmosphere, it is imperative that extra shielding be used on all faces of the ACM's touch, either edge to edge or face to face, that joint is sealed so no bacteria can sneak through. Any face of an ACM shared by another ACM will not need shielding, of course, nor will a face which cannot be reached from the outside. Roger could just put extra shielding on all of the faces of every ACM, but the cost would be prohibitive.

Formatting Text,http://poj.org/problem?id=1093, 1000MS, 10000K,"Writings e-mails is fun, but, unfortunately, they do not look very nice, mainly because not all lines have the same lengths. In this problem, your task is to write an e-mail formatting program which reformats a paragraph of an e-mail (e.g. by inserting spaces) so that, afterwards, all lines have the same length (even the last one of each paragraph). The easiest way to perform this task would be to insert more spaces between the words in lines which are too short. But this is not the best way. Consider the following example: ****************************This is the example you areactually considering.Let us assume that we want to get lines as long as the row of stars. Then, by simply inserting spaces, we would get ****************************This is the example you  areactually        considering.But this looks rather odd because of the big gap in the second line. By moving the word ``are'' from the first to the second line, we get a better result: ****************************This  is  the  example   youare  actually   considering.Of course, this has to be formalized. To do this, we assign a badness to each gap between words. The badness assigned to a gap of n spaces is (n - 1)^2. The goal of the program is to minimize the sum of all badnesses. For example, the badness of the first example is 1 + 7^2 = 50 whereas the badness of the second one is only 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 = 12. In the output, every line has to start and to end with a word. (I.e. there cannot be a gap at the beginning or the end of a line.) The only exception to this is the following: If a line contains only one word this word shall be put at the beginning of the line, and a badness of 500 is assigned to this line if it is shorter than it should be.

Farmland,http://poj.org/problem?id=1092, 1000MS, 65536K,"We have a map for farming land in a country. The whole farming land of the  country is divided into a set of disjoint farming regions. Each farmer owns  only one farming region in this country. There is a boundary fence between two neighboring farming regions. The farmland map for this country can be represented in a plane graph. The following Figure-1 shows one example.Figure-1: Farmland graph G(V,E) There are two types of edges, boundary edge and non-boundary edge. All edges of G(V,E) except (v8, v6) and (v11, v10) are boundary edges which are between two neighboring farming regions. The ""proper farming region"" in a Farmland graph is a closed region bounded by a simple cycle and it should not contain any vertices or edges inside. In this figure, the polygon is a proper farming region, and the region is not a proper farming region since its boundary cycle is not simple. We assume that the farmland graph G(V,E) is a simple connected graph, which  does not allow self-loops (Figure-2 (a)) and parallel edges (Figure-2 (b)).Also in Farmland graph G(V,E), we do not consider the outer face of G(V,E).You can see that there are 2 proper farming regions in G(V,E) shown in Figure-1,namely  and , since there are no vertices or edges inside. But the polygon is not a proper farming region since vertex v3, v4, and v5 are located in that region. Similarly, the region  is not a proper region because a vertex v10 is inside the region.A degenerate polygon  is not a proper region because it has no valid area inside. Figure-2: (a) self-loop  , and (b) 3 parallel edges { ,, }There are other assumptions for input farmland graph data.   1. There is at least one proper farming region.   2. The position of each vertex in Farmland graph is distinct.   3. There is no edge crossing, which means the graph G(V,E) is a plane graph.   4. Farmland graph G(V,E) is simple and connected.  Let us define the ""size"" of proper farming region. The size of proper farming region is the number of boundary edges of that region. For example, the size of the proper farming region  is 4.The problem is to find the number of proper regions that have a specified size.If you are requested to find the number of proper regions with size of 4 in the graph given in Figure-1, you must answer that there are 2 proper regions whose sizes are 4 because farming regions  and are proper regions and their sizes are 4. If there are no such regions, then you have to print 0.","The input consists of M test cases. The first line of the input contains a positive integer M, the number of test cases you are to solve.

Unfortunately, the room was built many years ago when reporters used very few electric and electronic devices and is equipped with only one receptacle of each type. These days, like everyone else, reporters require many such devices to do their jobs: laptops, cell phones, tape recorders, pagers, coffee pots, microwave ovens, blow dryers, curling irons, tooth brushes, etc. Naturally, many of these devices can operate on batteries, but since the meeting is likely to be long and tedious, you want to be able to plug in as many as you can. Before the meeting begins, you gather up all the devices that the reporters would like to use, and attempt to set them up. You notice that some of the devices use plugs for which there is no receptacle. You wonder if these devices are from countries that didn't exist when the room was built. For some receptacles, there are several devices that use the corresponding plug. For other receptacles, there are no devices that use the corresponding plug. In order to try to solve the problem you visit a nearby parts supply store.

Unscrambling Images,http://poj.org/problem?id=1086, 1000MS, 10000K,"Quadtrees are commonly used for encoding digital images in a compact form. Given an n * n image (where n is a power of 2, 1 1. If every pixel in the region associated with the current node has an intensity value of p, then the node is made a leaf and it is assigned an associated value of p. 2. Otherwise, four nodes are added as children of the current node. The region is divided into four equal (square) quadrants and each quadrant is assigned to one child node. The algorithm recurses on each of the children nodes. When the process terminates, we obtain a quadtree in which every internal node has four children. Every leaf node has an associated value representing the intensity of the region corresponding to the leaf node. An example of an image and its quadtree encoding is shown below. We have assumed that the four children represent, from left to right, the upper left, upper right, lower left, and lower right quadrants, respectively. To easily identify a node in a quadtree, we assign a number to each node by the following rules: 1. The root is numbered 0. 2. If the number of a node is k, then its children, from left to right, are numbered 4k+1; 4k+2; 4k+3; 4k +4. Images encoded as quadtrees can be encrypted by a secret password as follows: whenever a subdivision is performed, the four branches are reordered. The reordering may be different at each node, but it is completely determined by the password and the node number. Unfortunately, some people use the ""save password"" feature in the encoding program and use the same password for multiple images. By observing the encoding of a well-chosen test image, any image encoded with the same password can be decoded without the password. In this test image, each pixel has a distinct intensity from 0 to n^2-1 arranged from left-to-right, top-to-bottom in increasing order. An example for n = 16 is given below: You managed to gain access to the encoding program and used it to encode the test image. Given the quadtree encoding of the test image, write a program to decode any other image encoded with the same password. ","You will be given a number of cases in the input. The first line of input consists of a positive integer indicating the number of test cases to follow. Each test case starts with a line containing n, followed by the quadtree encoding of the test image and the quadtree encoding of the secret image to be decoded. Each quadtree encoding starts with a line containing a positive integer m indicating the number of leaf nodes in the tree. The next m lines are of the form: k intensity which specifies that the node numbered k is a leaf node with the specified intensity as the associated leaf value. Nodes not specified are either internal nodes or absent in the quadtree. You may assume that all intensities are between 0 and 255, inclusively. You may also assume that each quadtree encoding is a valid output obtained from the encoding lgorithm described above. ","For each test case, print the case number followed by a blank line.

The game ends after all dotted lines are filled in, and the player with the most triangles wins the game.

For example, from December 19, 1924, you can move either to December  20,  1924,  the  next  calendar  date,  or  January  19,  1925,  the  same  day  of  the  next month.  From January 31 2001, however, you can move only to February 1, 2001, because February 31, 2001 is invalid.   A player wins the game when he/she exactly reaches the date of November 4, 2001. If a player moves to a date after November 4, 2001, he/she looses the game.  Write a program that decides whether, given an initial date, Adam, the first mover, has a winning strategy.  For this game, you need to identify leap years, where February has 29 days. In the Gregorian calendar, leap years occur in years exactly divisible by four. So, 1993, 1994, and 1995 are not leap years, while 1992 and 1996 are leap years. Additionally, the years ending with 00 are leap years only if they are divisible by 400. So, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, and 2200 are not leap years, while 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years.  ","The input consists of T test cases. The number of test cases (T ) is given in the first line of the input file. Each test case is written in a line and corresponds to an initial date. The three integers in a line, YYYY MM DD, represent  the  date  of  the DD-th  day  of  MM-th month  in  the  year  of  YYYY. Remember  that  initial  dates  are randomly chosen from the interval between January 1, 1900 and November 4, 2001. ","Print exactly one line for each test case. The line should contain the answer ""YES"" or ""NO"" to the question of whether Adam has a winning strategy against Eve. Since we have T  test cases, your program should output totally T  lines of ""YES"" or ""NO"". ","3

You Who?,http://poj.org/problem?id=1081, 1000MS, 10000K,"On the first day of first grade at Friendly Elementrary School, it is customary for each student to spend one minute talking to every classmate that he or she does not already know.  When student Bob sees an unfamilar face, he says ``You who?''  A typical response is ``Me Charlie, you who?''  Then Bob says, ``Me Bob!'' and they talk for a minute.  It's very cute.  Then, after a minute, they part and each looks for another stranger to greet. This takes time.  In class of twenty-nine or thirty mutual strangers, it takes 29 minutes; time that, according to teachers, could be better spent learning the alphabet.  Of course, it is rare to have a first grade class where nobody knows anyone else; there are neighbors and playmates who already know each other, so they don't have to go through the get-to-know-you minutes with each other. The two first grade teachers have requested that, to save time, students be allocated to their two classes so that the difference in the sizes of the classes is at most one, and the time it takes to complete these introductions is as small as possible.  There are no more than 60 students in the incoming first grade class. How can the assignment of students to classes be made?  Your job is to write the software that answers the question. ","The school records include information about these student friendships, represented as lists of numbers.  If there are 29 students, then they are represented by the numbers 1 to 29.  The record for a single student includes, first, his/her student identification number (1 to 29, in this example), then the number of his/her acquaintances, then a list of them in no particular order. So, for example, this record 17 4 5 2 14 22 indicates that student 17 knows 4 students: 5, 2, and so on.  The records for all the students in the incoming class are represented as the list of numbers that results from concatenating all the student records together.  Spaces and line breaks are irrelevent in this format.  Thus, this 1 1 2 2 1 1 is a whole database, indicating that there are only two students in the incoming class, and they know each other; and this 1 2 3 4 2 2 3 4 3 2 1 2 4 2 1 2 indicates that 1 doesn't know 2, and 3 doesn't know 4, but all other pairs know each other. The database has been checked for consistency, so that if A knows B, then B knows A.","Your output should begin with a number that tells how long it will take to complete the introductions in the best possible legal class assignment.

Human Gene Functions,http://poj.org/problem?id=1080, 1000MS, 10000K,"It is well known that a human gene can be considered as a sequence, consisting of four nucleotides, which are simply denoted by four letters, A, C, G, and T. Biologists have been interested in identifying human genes and  determining  their  functions,  because  these  can  be  used  to  diagnose  human  diseases  and  to  design  new drugs for them.  A human gene can be  identified  through a  series of  time-consuming biological experiments, often with  the help of computer programs. Once a sequence of a gene is obtained, the next job is to determine its function. One of the methods for biologists to use in determining the function of a new gene sequence that they have just identified is to search a database with the new gene as a query. The database to be searched stores many gene sequences and their functions – many researchers have been submitting their genes and functions to the database and the database is freely accessible through the Internet.  A database  search will  return a  list of gene  sequences  from  the database  that are  similar to  the query gene. Biologists  assume  that  sequence  similarity  often  implies  functional  similarity.  So,  the  function  of  the  new gene might be one of the functions that the genes from the list have. To exactly determine which one is the right one another series of biological experiments will be needed.  Your job is to make a program that compares two genes and determines their similarity as explained below. Your program may be used as a part of the database search if you can provide an efficient one.  Given two genes AGTGATG and GTTAG, how similar are they? One of the methods to measure the similarity of two genes is called alignment. In an alignment, spaces are inserted, if necessary, in appropriate positions of the genes to make them equally long and score the resulting genes according to a scoring matrix.   For example, one space is inserted into AGTGATG to result in AGTGAT-G, and three spaces are inserted into GTTAG  to  result  in –GT--TAG. A  space  is denoted by  a minus  sign  (-). The  two genes are now of  equal length. These two strings are aligned:   AGTGAT-G -GT--TAG   In this alignment, there are four matches, namely, G in the second position, T in the third, T in the sixth,  and G in the eighth. Each pair of aligned characters is assigned a score according to the following scoring matrix.   denotes  that  a  space-space match  is  not  allowed. The  score  of  the  alignment  above  is  (-3)+5+5+(-2)+(-3)+5+(-3)+5=9.  Of course, many other alignments are possible. One is shown below (a different number of spaces are inserted into different positions):  AGTGATG -GTTA-G  This alignment gives a score of  (-3)+5+5+(-2)+5+(-1) +5=14. So, this one is better than the previous one. As a matter of fact, this one is optimal since no other alignment can have a higher score. So, it is said that the similarity of the two genes is 14. ","The input consists of T  test cases. The number of test cases  ) (T  is given in the first line of the input file. Each test case consists of two lines: each line contains an integer, the length of a gene, followed by a gene sequence. The length of each gene sequence is at least one and does not exceed 100.

Ratio,http://poj.org/problem?id=1079, 1000MS, 10000K,"If you ever see a televised report on stock market activity, you'll hear the anchorperson say something like ``Gainers outnumbered losers 14 to 9,'' which means that for every 14 stocks that increased in value that day, approximately 9 other stocks declined in value. Often, as you hear that, you'll see on the screen something like this: Gainers 1498 Losers   902 As a person with a head for numbers, you'll notice that the anchorperson could have said ``Gainers outnumbered losers 5 to 3'', which is a more accurate approximation to what really happened.  After all, the exact ratio of winners to losers is (to the nearest millionth) 1.660754, and he reported a ratio of 14 to 9, which is 1.555555, for an error of 0.105199; he could have said ``5 to 3'', and introduced an error of only 1.666667-1.660754=0.005913.  The estimate ``5 to 3'' is not as accurate as ``1498 to 902'' of course; evidently, another goal is to use small integers to express the ratio. So, why did the anchorperson say ``14 to 9?''  Because his algorithm is to lop off the last two digits of each number and use those as the approximate ratio. What the anchorman needs is a list of rational approximations of increasing accuracy, so that he can pick one to read on the air. Specifically, he needs a sequence {a_1, a_2, ..., a_n} where a_1 is a rational number with denominator 1 that most exactly matches the true ratio of winners to losers (rounding up in case of ties), a_{i+1} is the rational number with least denominator that provides a more accurate approximation than a_i, and a_n is the exact ratio, expressed with the least possible denominator.  Given this sequence, the anchorperson can decide which ratio gives the best tradeoff between accuracy and simplicity. For example, if 5 stocks rose in price and 4 fell, the best approximation with denominator 1 is 1/1; that is, for every stock that fell, about one rose.  This answer differs from the exact answer by 0.25 (1.0 vs 1.25).  The best approximations with two in the denominator are 2/2 and 3/2, but neither is an improvement on the ratio 1/1, so neither would be considered.  The best approximation with three in the denominator 4/3, is more accurate than any seen so far, so it is one that should be reported.  Finally, of course, 5/4 is exactly the ratio, and so it is the last number reported in the sequence. Can you automate this process and help the anchorpeople? ","input contains several pairs of positive integers. Each pair is on a line by itself, beginning in the first column and with a space between the two numbers.  The first number of a pair is the number of gaining stocks for the day, and the second number is the number of losing stocks for the day.   The total number of stocks never exceeds 5000. ","For each input pair, the standard output should contain a series of approximations to the ratio of gainers to losers.  The first approximation has '1' as denominator, and the last is exactly the ratio of gainers to losers, expressed as a fraction with least possible denominator.  The approximations in between are increasingly accurate and have increasing denominators, as described above. The approximations for a pair are printed one to a line, beginning in column one, with the numerator and denominator of an approximation separated by a slash (``/'').  A blank line separates one sequence of approximations from another. ","5 4

Gizilch,http://poj.org/problem?id=1078, 1000MS, 10000K,"The game of gizilch has very simple rules.  First 100 grapes are labeled, in nontoxic ink, with the numbers 1 to 100.  Then, with a cry of ``GIZILCH!'', the referee fires the grapes up into the air with a giant gizilcher.  The two players, who each start with a score of  ``1'', race to eat the falling (or, shortly thereafter, fallen) grapes and, at the same time, multiply their scores by the numbers written on the grapes they eat.  After a minute, the hungry squirrels are let loose to finish the remaining grapes, and each contestant reports his score, the product of the numbers on the grapes he's eaten.  The unofficial winner is the player who announces the highest score. Inevitably, though, disputes arise, and so the official winner is not determined until the disputes are resolved.  The player who claims the lower score is entitled to challenge his opponent's score.  The player with the lower score is presumed to have told the truth, because if he were to lie about his score, he would surely come up with a bigger better lie.  The challenge is upheld if the player with the higher score has a score that cannot be achieved with grapes not eaten by the challenging player.  So, if the challenge is successful, the player claiming the lower score wins. So, for example, if one player claims 343 points and the other claims 49, then clearly the first player is lying; the only way to score 343 is by eating grapes labeled 7 and 49, and the only way to score 49 is by eating a grape labeled 49.  Since each of two scores requires eating the grape labeled 49, the one claiming 343 points is presumed to be lying. On the other hand, if one player claims 162 points and the other claims 81, it is possible for both to be telling the truth (e.g. one eats grapes 2, 3 and 27, while the other eats grape 81), so the challenge would not be upheld. Unfortunately, anyone who is willing to referee a game of gizilch is likely to have himself consumed so many grapes (in a liquid form) that he or she could not reasonably be expected to perform the intricate calculations that refereeing requires.  Hence the need for you, sober programmer, to provide a software solution. ","Pairs of unequal, positive numbers, with each pair on a single line, that are claimed scores from a game of gizilch.

Eight,http://poj.org/problem?id=1077, 1000MS, 65536K,"The 15-puzzle has been around for over 100 years; even if you don't know it by that name, you've seen it.  It is constructed with 15 sliding tiles, each with a number from 1 to 15 on it, and all packed into a 4 by 4 frame with one tile missing.  Let's call the missing tile 'x'; the object of the puzzle is to arrange the tiles so that they are ordered as:  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15  x where the only legal operation is to exchange 'x' with one of the tiles with which it shares an edge.  As an example, the following sequence of moves solves a slightly scrambled puzzle:  1  2  3  4    1  2  3  4    1  2  3  4    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8    5  6  7  8    5  6  7  8    5  6  7  8  9  x 10 12    9 10  x 12    9 10 11 12    9 10 11 12 13 14 11 15   13 14 11 15   13 14  x 15   13 14 15  x            r->           d->           r-> The letters in the previous row indicate which neighbor of the 'x' tile is swapped with the 'x' tile at each step; legal values are 'r','l','u' and 'd', for right, left, up, and down, respectively. Not all puzzles can be solved; in 1870, a man named Sam Loyd was famous for distributing an unsolvable version of the puzzle, and frustrating many people.  In fact, all you have to do to make a regular puzzle into an unsolvable one is to swap two tiles (not counting the missing 'x' tile, of course). In this problem, you will write a program for solving the less well-known 8-puzzle, composed of tiles on a three by three arrangement. ","You will receive  a description of a configuration of the 8 puzzle.

Bowl,http://poj.org/problem?id=1076, 1000MS, 65536K,"Technology hasn't come quickly to Joe's Bowl-a-rama.  Minimum wage teens, and not those fancy machines, still reset the pins, and the grizzled veteran bowlers still mark up their own score sheets. Unfortunately for Joe Junior, who now runs the Bowl-a-rama, people  his age are a little shaky on the scoring, especially after the second beer, and are staying away in droves, bowling instead at the new CyberBowl 2000 down the street, which scores automatically.  Joe Junior figures that if he puts a cheap PC next to every lane, he can get a cheap, semi-automatic scoring system going.  His plan is for the PC's to run software that only requires a bowler to enter the  number of pins that remain standing after every throw -- and the software will keep score and tell the bowler when his game is over.  Joe  Junior would like to hire you to write the software. Of course, since you may not know how to score a game of bowling either, Joe Junior has provided a description of the rules.  The basic game consists of ten frames.  In a frame, you get two chances to throw a ball down the alley and knock over as many pins as you can.   There are ten pins standing at the beginning of a frame, and none are replaced after getting knocked over on the first ball, so the most pins you can knock over in a frame is ten.  You get one point for each pin knocked over.  In addition, there are two bonuses you can  earn. If you knock over all ten pins on your first ball of the frame, you have scored a ``strike''; besides the ten points for the pins, your score in this frame is increased by the total number of pins knocked down with your next two balls.  Those next two balls are usually part of another frame (or two) and score points in that frame (or those frames) as well.  If you knock over all ten pins in a frame, but it takes you two balls to do it, you have scored a ``spare''; in addition to your ten points for pins knocked down, your score for the frame is increased by the number of pins you knock down on your next ball.  Of course, those pins also count as part of the next frame.  If you  score a spare (or strike) in the final (tenth) frame, you are entitled to one (or two) extra balls to determine your tenth frame bonus.  A perfect game scores 300 points, because each frame scores 30, 10 for knocking down 10 pins, and 20 for knocking down 20 pins with the next two balls combined. Now, are you ready to sign on to write the software? ","Input contains several complete or partial games.  A game is described by a single line with a single name, not to exceed 12 characters, and sequence of numbers, one for each ball thrown indicating the number of pins still standing after that throw,ended with -1. According  to the rules, there are from 11 to 21 throws in a game; no input line will show throws beyond the last throw of the game.  The number of games described in a file is not predetermined, so you'll have to detect the end of the input file. ","The standard output will contain, on successful completion of the program, two output lines for each input line.  The first output line contains the name of the bowler and a record of the throws in each frame.  This record shows, for each frame, the number of pins knocked down for each throw as a digit, with some exceptions.  For a throw that knocks down no pins, a dash (\verb$-$) is used instead of a `0'. An 'X' indicates a throw that knocks down all 10 pins on the first try.  A slash ('/') indicates a throw that finishes knocking down all the pins, after the previous throw left some standing.  Otherwise, a throw is shown as a digit (`1' to `9').  The number of throws in a frame may be one (a strike in frames 1 to 9), or three (a strike or spare in frame 10, followed by bonus balls), but is usually two.  Here are examples of throw markings for a variety of situations: MarkingComment81Knocked down 8 balls on the first throw, one on the next7/Knocked down 7 balls on the first throw, then the restXKnocked down all balls on the first throw9-Knocked  down 9 balls on the first throw, none on the next8/XKnocked down 8 balls on the first throw of  frame 10, then the rest,then all the pins on the bonus throwX-/Knocked down ten balls on the first  throw of frame 10, then missed all the pins on the first bonus throw and knocked them all down on thesecond bonus throwThe second output line shows cumulative scores.  The cumulative score for the first frame is just the score for pins knocked down in frame, plus bonus points if they apply.  The cumulative score for any other frame is the cumulative score for the previous frame plus the score for pins knocked down in that frame, plus the bonus pins that may have been earned for a strike or spare in this frame.  It is possible to have markings on line one for a frame, but no score on line two, in the event that the frame is a strike or spare but the bonus points for the frame aren't yet known. The format for this output requires that the bowler's name be left-justified.  The fields for each frame are three characters wide, with a space separating each field.  The fields begin in columns 14, 18, 22, and so on.  The record of the throws in the first line is left justified in its field.  The cumulative score is right justified in its field.  There is a blank line that separates the scores of one bowler from the scores of another. ","Chuck 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 -1

University Entrance Examination,http://poj.org/problem?id=1075, 1000MS, 10000K,"There is a fierce competition among high-school graduates in Iran to pass the centralized nationwide university entrance examination. Ministry of Science, Research, and Technology has set up the Education Evaluation Organization (EEO) to take care of all aspects of this big exam. This year the EEO managed to select some 150,000 students to enter universities out of 1.4 million high school graduates participated in a tough 4.5 hours multiple-choice exam. This annual event is usually preceded by a multi-billion Rial business offering preparatory courses to enthusiastic students. A few weeks after the big exam day, each participant receives a score sheet, and a list of Field-Department-University (FDU), displaying each field of study in the universities’ departments (e.g., the Software Engineering field of Computer Engineering department at Sharif University of Technology) along with their capacity for that year. The eligible participants (those who have scored enough to be allowed to declare their FDU priorities) fill out a priority indication form, and declare the FDUs they like to enter, in the order of their preference. The EEO processes the forms, and considering the total score, the participant’s FDU priority list, and some other selection rules, enters the accepted participants’ names in the list of each FDU, until all capacities are exhausted. Those who are not entered in a list are considered failed and may try again next year. Each accepted participant’s name may be entered in only one list.One of the interesting selection rules is to persuade participants to enter universities in the vicinity of their home towns. This is to help reduce the number of requests for staying in the university dormitories. The selection process is so complex and so sensitive to many, that EEO has decided to hire the very best programmers in Iran to design a new selection algorithm and write a completely new program for what they have been doing for years. ACM programming contest is where these programmers can be found.There are N students S1 to SN , and M items F1 to FM , each representing one of the FDUs. There are also a number of geographic regions. For each participant, the total score, the geographic region where his/her high school diploma was awarded, and a priority list of his/her wanted FDUs are available. For each FDU, the geographic region where the corresponding university is located, and its capacity for that year is recorded.Write a program to compute the list of accepted students with the FDU they can enter to, given the above list of input data. Your program must abide with the following rules:1. (Local student selection rule) Suppose two students A and B have both selected F in their priority lists and F is in region R. Also suppose that score of A is greater than B's score. Then, if B is from region R (local) and A is from other regions (non-local), and B's score is greater than 70% of A's score, then B has priority over A to enter F. In all other cases A has priority over B to enter F.2. (Fairness rule) Students should be treated according to their priority list of FDUs. That is, an accepted student will be accepted to the first possible FDU he/she can enter.Note: We assume that scores are all different integer values.",The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 ,"Outputs for different test cases are separated by exactly one blank line. For each test case, you should write N lines, one for each of the N students. If student i has been accepted to FDU Fj, then ith line should contain j, and not accepted, if that student has not been accepted in any FDU of his/her interest. ","1

Parallel Expectations,http://poj.org/problem?id=1074, 1000MS, 10000K,"We are to predict some facts about the behavior of a single processor designed for running two programs in parallel. Programs are sequences of commands according to the following grammar: ->   * ->   :=    ->  + | -  ->   | A  is a sequence of (at most 20) alphanumeric characters (A...Z, a...z, and 0...9) starting with a letter (not case sensitive). A  is an unsigned integer number (less than 100). There may be arbitrary number of blank or tab characters between tokens.Before execution, programs are translated into machine language. A statement of the form X := Y + Z is translated to the following set of machine instructions:Mov R1, YMov R2, ZAdd R1, R2Mov X, R1A MOV instruction copies the content of its second operand into its first operand. An Add (Sub) instruction, adds (subtracts) its second operand from its first operand and the result is stored in the first operand. Note that Y and Z denote either a variable or an integer constant. Instructions generated for the command X := Y - Z is similar to the above instructions, except that Sub command is used instead of Add.The processor is given two machine language programs and starts executing them from the first instruction. In each step, it randomly selects one of the two programs and runs the next instruction from the selected program. This continues until one program reaches its end. In this situation, the remaining instructions from the other one are executed sequentially to the end and the processor stops. It is assumed that all variables are shared between two programs, but each program has a separate register set. The goal of this program is to compute the expected final value of all variables among all possible executions of the programs. More precisely, we want to consider every possible execution of the two programs and for each variable, calculate the average of its final value in different executions. It is assumed that the initial value of all variables is zero.","The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 OutputFor each test case, the output file should contain the expected final value of all variables in alphabetical order of variable names (digits precede letters in this order).

The Willy Memorial Program,http://poj.org/problem?id=1073, 1000MS, 10000K,"Willy the spider used to live in the chemistry laboratory of Dr. Petro. He used to wander about the lab pipes and sometimes inside empty ones. One night while he was in a pipe, he fell asleep. The next morning, Dr. Petro came to the lab. He didn't notice Willy while opening the valve to fill the pipes with hot water. Meanwhile, Stanley the gray mouse got what was going to happen. No time to lose! Stan ran hard to reach the valve before Willy gets drawn, but... Alas! He couldn't make it! Poor Willy was boiled in hot water, but his memory is still in our hearts. Though Stan tried his best, we want to write a program, in the memory of Willy, to compute the time Stan had, to rescue Willy, assuming he started to run just when the doctor opened the valve.To simplify the problem, assume the pipes are all vertical cylinders with diameter 1 cm. Every pipe is open from the top and closed at the bottom. Some of the pipes are connected through special horizontal pipes named links. The links have very high flow capacity, but are so tiny that at any given time, the volume of water inside them is negligible. The water enters from top of one of the pipes with a constant rate of 0.25PI cm3/sec and begins to fill the pipe from the bottom until the water reaches a link through which it flows horizontally and begins to fill the connected pipe. From elementary physics we know if two pipes are connected and the surface of the water is above the connecting link, the level of water in both pipes remains the same when we try to fill one of them. In this case the water fills each pipe with a rate equal to half of the rate of incoming water. As an example, consider the following configuration:First, the lower 2 centimeters of the left pipe is filled with water at full rate, then, the lower 3 centimeters of the right pipe is filled, and after that, the upper part of the two pipes are filled in parallel at half rate. The input to your program is a configuration of pipes and links, and a target level in one of the pipes (the heavy dotted line in the above figure). The program should report how long it takes for the level of water to reach the target level. For the above configuration, the output is 9 seconds.It is assumed that the water falls very rapidly, such that the time required for the water to fall can be neglected. The target level is always assumed to be a bit higher than the specified level for it. As an example, if we set the target point to level 4 in the left pipe in the figure above, the elapsed time for water to reach that target is assumed to be 5 (not 2), Also note that if the water reaches to the top of a pipe (say in level x), it won't pour out outside the pipe until empty spaces in connected pipes below level x are filled (if can be filled, i.e. the level of water reaches the connecting links). (Note that there may be some links at level x, to which water is entered). After all such spaces are filled; the water level would not go up further.","To describe positions, we assume the coordinates are expressed as (x, y) and the origin lies in the top-left of all pipes and links. (Note that y coordinates are increased downwards). All coordinates are integer numbers between 0 and 100, inclusive.The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 After input data describing the pipes, there is a line containing a single integer l, which is the number of links (0 The last line for each test case contains two numbers. The first is the number of target pipe (starting from one, with the order appeared in test data). The second line is the desired y for the level of water in the target pipe (note that the specified level may be out of the pipe at all).You can assume the following about the input:.	The water enters into the first pipe..	No link crosses a pipe..	No two links have the same y coordinates..	No two pipes have the same upper-left x coordinates..	Both endpoints of each link are connected to pipes.","The output should contain exactly t lines with no blank lines in between, each corresponding to one test case. Each output line should contain the time required for the water to reach the target level in the target pipe (an integer number). If in a specific test case, the water never reaches the target level, the line should contain No Solution string in it.","1

Illusive Chase,http://poj.org/problem?id=1071, 1000MS, 10000K,"Tom the robocat is presented in a Robotics Exhibition for an enthusiastic audience of youngsters, placed around an m * n field. Tom which is turned off initially is placed in some arbitrary point in the field by a volunteer from the audience. At time zero of the show, Tom is turned on by a remote control. Poor Tom is shown a holographic illusion of Jerry in a short distance such that a direct path between them is either vertical or horizontal. There may be obstacles in the field, but the illusion is always placed such that in the direct path between Tom and the illusion, there would be no obstacles. Tom tries to reach Jerry, but as soon as he gets there, the illusion changes its place and the chase goes on. Let's call each chase in one direction (up, down, left, and right), a chase trip. Each trip starts from where the last illusion was deemed and ends where the next illusion is deemed out. After a number of chase trips, the holographic illusion no more shows up, and poor Tom wonders what to do next. At this time, he is signaled that for sure, if he returns to where he started the chase, a real Jerry is sleeping and he can catch it.To simplify the problem, we can consider the field as a grid of squares. Some of the squares are occupied with obstacles. At any instant, Tom is in some unoccupied square of the grid and so is Jerry, such that the direct path between them is either horizontal or vertical. It's assumed that each time Tom is shown an illusion; he can reach it by moving only in one of the four directions, without bumping into an obstacle. Tom moves into an adjacent square of the grid by taking one and only one step.The problem is that Tom's logging mechanism is a bit fuzzy, thus the number of steps he has taken in each chase trip is logged as an interval of integers, e.g. 2 to 5 steps to the left. Now is your turn to send a program to Tom's memory to help him go back. But to ease your task in this contest, your program should only count all possible places that he might have started the chase from.","The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 OutputFor each test case, there should be a single line, containing an integer indicating the number of cells that Tom might have started the chase from.Sample Input2

Deformed Wheel,http://poj.org/problem?id=1070, 1000MS, 10000K,"The village's carpentry is located by a hill side. The carpenter's two little boys play with a piece of wood which looks like a deformed wheel with two identical convex polygon-shaped faces. One boy sets the wooden wheel on a slope at the hill top and let it roll down. The other boy is to quickly place himself at where he guesses the rolling wood would stop. Your program is to help him make the right guess.More formally, we consider the wooden wheel as a simple convex polygon and we approximate the hill by a sequence of connected line segments with decreasing slopes. The slope of the last segment in the sequence is assumed to be zero, and the slope of the first segment is assumed to be a positive number. Initially, the wheel is placed on the hill such that there is at least one point of contact between the wheel and segments. For example in the following figure, the wheel in its initial position is drawn in solid lines, while the final position is drawn in dashed lines.At any instant, the wheel rotates around one of its vertices, say P, if the y-coordinate of its center of gravity is decreased (note that this condition is necessary at any instant during the motion). It can be easily shown that at any instant, there is at most one such vertex. Rotation around P is stopped when the wheel touches a segment. The motion continues until no vertex can be found such that the wheel can rotate around it. At any instant, assume that changing the position of the center of gravity in any direction for at most 10-5 units, does not affect the stability of the wheel. Also assume that the friction between the wheel and the surface of the hill is so high that the wheel never slides on the surface.","The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 OutputFor each test case, there should be a single line in the output , containing two numbers which are x and y coordinates of the wheel's center of gravity.

Modular multiplication of polynomials,http://poj.org/problem?id=1060, 1000MS, 10000K,"Consider polynomials whose coefficients are 0 and 1. Addition of two polynomials is achieved by 'adding' the coefficients  for  the  corresponding  powers  in  the polynomials. The  addition  of  coefficients  is  performed  by addition modulo 2, i.e., (0 + 0) mod 2 = 0, (0 + 1) mod 2 = 1, (1 + 0) mod 2 = 1, and (1 + 1) mod 2 = 0. Hence, it is the same as the exclusive-or operation. (x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) + (x^7 + x + 1) = x^7 + x^6 + x^4 + x^2  Subtraction of two polynomials is done similarly. Since subtraction of coefficients is performed by subtraction modulo  2  which  is  also  the  exclusive-or  operation,  subtraction  of  polynomials  is  identical  to  addition  of polynomials.    (x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) - (x^7 + x + 1) = x^7 + x^6 + x^4 + x^2   Multiplication of two polynomials is done in the usual way (of course, addition of coefficients is performed by addition modulo 2).  (x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) (x^7 + x + 1)  =  x^13 + x^11 + x^9 + x^8 + x^6 + x^5 + x^4 + x^3 + 1  Multiplication of two polynomials f(x) and g(x) modulo a polynomial h(x) is the remainder of f(x)g(x) divided by h(x).  (x^6 + x^4 + x^2 + x + 1) (x^7 + x + 1) modulo (x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x + 1) =  x^7 + x^6 + 1 The largest exponent of a polynomial is called its degree. For example, the degree of x^7 + x^6 + 1 is 7.  Given three polynomials f(x), g(x), and h(x), you are to write a program that computes f(x)g(x) modulo h(x). We assume that the degrees of both f(x) and g(x) are less than the degree of h(x).  The degree of a polynomial is less than 1000.  Since  coefficients  of  a  polynomial  are  0  or  1,  a  polynomial  can  be  represented  by  d+1  and  a  bit  string  of length  d+1,  where  d  is  the  degree  of  the  polynomial  and  the  bit  string  represents  the  coefficients  of  the polynomial.

Chutes and Ladders,http://poj.org/problem?id=1059, 1000MS, 10000K,"A popular board game for children is called ""Chutes and Ladders"".  The board has squares which are numbered from 1 to 100, and players have counters which start on the theoretical square 0.  The players take turns at throwing a die with the numbers 1 to 6 on it, and each moves his or her counter forward the number of squares corresponding to the number on the die (the square they reach is found by adding the die number to the square number their counter is on).  The first person to reach square 100 is the winner.  The interest is caused by the fact that pairs of squares are connected together by ""ladders"" (which connect a lower-numbered square to a higher-numbered square) and ""chutes"" (which run from high to low).  If a counter lands on the start of a chute or ladder (i.e., this is the square reached after throwing the die), then the counter is moved to the corresponding square at the end of the chute or ladder.  Note that landing on the end square of a ladder or a chute has no effect, only the start square counts.  Furthermore, there are some squares such that if a player's counter lands on them, then the player must either miss the next turn, or immediately throw the die again for another turn, depending on what is written on the board.  A miss-a-turn or extra-turn square is never the start or end of a ladder or chute.  If a player is on square 95 or higher, then a die throw which takes them past 100 must be ignored - thus a player on square 99 must ignore all throws which are not 1.  ","Input  will start with a set of less than 1000 die throws which you must use for all games, starting each new game with the first player ""throwing"" the first number in the set, the next player ""throwing"" the second number, and so on.  This set of die throws will simply be a list of random numbers between 1 and 6, separated by single spaces, with not more than 80 characters on each line.  It will be terminated by the number 0.  After this set of die throws, there will be one or more game sets.  Each game set is in three parts.  The first part is a line containing a single number giving the number of players in the game.  This will be more than 1 and less than 6.  Then the board is described, in two parts. The first part lists the ladders and the chutes on the board, each ladder or chute being defined on a single line.  Each is given by two numbers, from 1 to 99,separated by one or more spaces.  The first number gives the start square, and the second number gives the end square; so it is a ladder if the first number is less than the second number, and a chute if the order is the other way.  The chute/ladder definitions are terminated by a line containing two 0's.  The second part of the board description gives the lose-a-turn/extra-turn squares, if there are any.  These are single numbers, one per line, defining the squares.  If the number is negative, its positive counterpart is a lose-a-turn square; if positive, it represents an extra-turn square.  (For example, -16 means that square 16 on the board is a lose-a-turn square, while a 25 means that players landing on square 25 must immediately roll again.)   The end of this set of descriptions, and of the game description, is given by a single 0.  The end of all the game descriptions is given by a game with the number of players equal to 0.","Output must be one line for each game in the input, giving the number of the player who wins the game.  Every game will determine a winner in fewer throws than those given at the start of the data.","3 6 3 2 5 1 3 4 2 3 1 2 0

They also stipulated that during the 5 evenings, every member of the club will share a table exactly once with each member of the club. Mr. I.B. Emm, the restaurateur, assigned his Maitre D' the task of scheduling the seating for the 5 evenings. On the first evening, the Maitre D' seated the members as they arrived and recorded their seating. Each subsequent evening, he carefully planned the seating to match the requirement that no member will be dining twice with some other member.  Unfortunately, the Maitre D' disappeared on the morning of the fourth evening. Mr. Emm was left only with his notes which included the recorded seating arrangements during the previous 3 evenings. As he was trying to schedule the seating for the remaining evenings, it dawned on him that this task may not be that easy.

The Troublesome Frog,http://poj.org/problem?id=1054, 5000MS, 100000K,"In Korea, the naughtiness of the cheonggaeguri, a small frog, is legendary.  This is a well-deserved reputation, because the frogs jump through your rice paddy at night, flattening rice plants.  In the morning, after noting which plants have been flattened, you want to identify the path of the frog which did the most damage.  A frog always jumps through the paddy in a straight line, with every hop the same length:Your rice paddy has plants arranged on the intersection points of a grid as shown in Figure-1, and the troublesome frogs hop completely through your paddy, starting outside the paddy on one side and ending outside the paddy on the other side as shown in Figure-2:Many frogs can jump through the paddy, hopping from rice plant to rice plant.  Every hop lands on a plant and flattens it, as in Figure-3.  Note that some plants may be landed on by more than one frog during the night.  Of course, you can not see the lines showing the paths of the frogs or any of their hops outside of your paddy ?for the situation in Figure-3, what you can see is shown in Figure-4:From Figure-4, you can reconstruct all the possible paths which the frogs may have followed across your paddy.  You are only interested in frogs which have landed on at least 3 of your rice plants in their voyage through the paddy.  Such a path is said to be a frog path.  In this case, that means that the three paths shown in Figure-3 are frog paths (there are also other possible frog paths). The vertical path down column 1 might have been a frog path with hop length 4 except there are only 2 plants flattened so we are not interested; and the diagonal path including the plants on row 2 col. 3, row 3 col. 4, and row 6 col. 7 has three flat plants but there is no regular hop length which could have spaced the hops in this way while still landing on at least 3 plants, and hence it is not a frog path.  Note also that along the line a frog path follows there may be additional flattened plants which do not need to be landed on by that path (see the plant at (2, 6) on the horizontal path across row 2 in Figure-4), and in fact some flattened plants may not be explained by any frog path at all.Your task is to write a program to determine the maximum number of landings in any single frog path (where the maximum is taken over all possible frog paths).  In Figure-4 the answer is 7, obtained from the frog path across row 6.","Your program is to read from standard input. The first line contains two integers R and C, respectively the number of rows and columns in your rice paddy, 1 OutputYour program is to write to standard output.

Symbol: diamonds, ovals, or squiggles.	Count: 1, 2, or 3 symbols.	Color: red, green, or purple.	Shading: outlined, filled, or stripedThe cards are shuffled and a tableau of twelve cards is laid out. Players then attempt to be the first to identify ""sets"" which exist in the tableau. Sets are removed as they are identified and new cards are dealt in their place. Play continues in this manner until all cards have been used. The winner is the player with the most sets.A set is a collection of three cards in which each characteristic is either the same on all three cards or different on all three cards. For example, the cards shown below form a set.To see how the cards above form a set, take each characteristic in turn. First, each card has different symbol: the first card has squiggles, the second diamonds, and the third ovals. Second, each card has the same count of symbols, three. Third each card has a different color, and finally, each card has a different shading. Thus, each characteristic is either the same on all three cards or different on all three cards, satisfying the requirement for a set.Consider the following example of three cards which do not form a set.Again, take each characteristic in turn. Each card has a different symbol, each card has a different count of symbols, and each card is the same color. So far this satisfies the requirements for a set. When the shading characteristic is considered, however, two cards are filled and one card is striped. Thus, the shading on all three cards is neither all the same nor all different, and so these cards do not form a set.","The input for this program consists of several tableaus of cards. The tableaus are listed in the input file one card per line, with a single blank line between tableaus. The end of  the input is marked by the end of the file. Each card in a tableau is specified by four consecutive characters on the input line. The first identifies the type of symbol on the card, and will be either a ""D"", ""O"", or ""S"", for Diamond, Oval, or Squiggle, respectively. The second character will be the digit 1, 2, or 3, identifying the number of symbols on the card.

Plato's Blocks,http://poj.org/problem?id=1052, 1000MS, 10000K,"Plato believed what we perceive is but a shadow of reality.  Recent archaeological excavations have uncovered evidence that this belief may have been encouraged by Plato's youthful amusement with cleverly-designed blocks.  The blocks have the curious property that, when held with any face toward a light source, they cast shadows of various letters, numbers, shapes, and patterns.  It is possible for three faces incident to a corner to correspond to three different shadow patterns.  Opposite faces, of course, cast shadows which are mirror images of one another.The blocks are formed by gluing together small cubes to form a single, connected object.  As an example, the figures below show, layer by layer, the internal structure of a block which can cast shadows of the letters ""E"", ""G"", or ""B"".Only a partial set of blocks was discovered, but the curious scientists would like to determine what combinations of shadows are possible.  Your program, the solution to this problem, will help them!  The program will input groups of shadow patterns, and for each group will report whether or not a solid can be constructed that will cast those three shadows.","The input contains a sequence of data sets, each specifying a dimension and three shadow patterns.  The first line of a data set contains a positive integer 1 ","For each data set in the input, output the data set number and one of the following messages:	Valid set of patterns	Impossible combinationFor a set of patterns to be considered valid, it must be possible to construct, by gluing unit cubes together along their faces, a one-piece solid capable of casting the shadow of each of the input patterns.","5

For the purposes of this problem we will assign them as follows (these are not the assignments for actual Morse code):      underscore    ..--    period    ---.        comma    .-.-    question mark    ----  Thus, the message ""ACM_GREATER_NY_REGION"" is encoded as:.- -.-. -- ..-- --. .-. . .- - . .-. ..-- -. -.-- ..-- .-. . --. .. --- -.M.E. Ohaver proposed an encryption scheme based on mutilating Morse code. Her scheme replaces the pauses between letters, necessary because Morse is a variable-length encoding that is not prefix-free, with a string that identifies the number of dots and dashes in each. For example, consider the message "".--.-.--"". Without knowing where the pauses should be, this could be ""ACM"", ""ANK"", or several other possibilities. If we add length information, however, "".--.-.--242"", then the code is unabiguous. Ohaver's scheme has three steps, the same for encryption and decryption:1.	Convert the text to Morse code without pauses but with a string of numbers to indicate code lengths2.	Reverse the string of numbers3.	Convert the dots and dashes back into to text using the reversed string of numbers as code lengthsAs an example, consider the encrypted message ""AKADTOF_IBOETATUK_IJN"". Converting to Morse code with a length string yields "".--.-.--..----..-...--..-...---.-.--..--.-..--...----.232313442431121334242"". Reversing the numbers and decoding yields the original message ""ACM_GREATER_NY_REGION"".","This problem requires that you implement Ohaver's encoding algorithm.

Date bugs,http://poj.org/problem?id=1044, 1000MS, 10000K,"There are rumors that there are a lot of computers having a problem with the year 2000. As they use only two digits to represent the year, the date will suddenly turn from 1999 to 1900. In fact, there are also many other, similar problems. On some systems, a 32-bit integer is used to store the number of seconds that have elapsed since a certain fixed date. In this way, when 2^32 seconds (about 136 Years) have elapsed, the date will jump back to whatever the fixed date is. Now, what can you do about all that mess? Imagine you have two computers C1 and C  with two different bugs: One with the ordinary Y2K-Bug (i. e. switching to a1 := 1900 instead of b1 := 2000) and one switching to a2 := 1904 instead of b2 := 2040. Imagine that the C1 displays the year y1 := 1941 and C2 the year y2 := 2005. Then you know the following (assuming that there are no other bugs): the real year can't be 1941, since, then, both computers would show the (same) right date. If the year would be 2005, y1 would be 1905, so this is impossible, too. Looking only at C1 , we know that the real year is one of the following: 1941, 2041, 2141, etc. We now can calculate what C2 would display in these years: 1941, 1905, 2005, etc. So in fact, it is possible that the actual year is 2141. To calculate all this manually is a lot of work. (And you don't really want to do it each time you forgot the actual year.) So, your task is to write a program which does the calculation for you: find the first possible real year, knowing what some other computers say (yi) and knowing their bugs (switching to ai instead of bi ). Note that the year ai is definitely not after the year the computer was built. Since the actual year can't be before the year the computers were built, the year your program is looking for can't be before any ai .

Each entry in the log has the form type arg , where type is either E, L or M: E indicates that criminal arg has entered the hideout; L indicates criminal arg has left the hideout; M indicates a message was intercepted from user ID arg. A line containing only the letter Q indicates the end of the log. Note that not all user ID's may be present in the log but each criminal name will be guaranteed to be in the log at least once. At the start of the log, the hideout is presumed to be empty. All names and user ID's consist of only lowercase letters and have length at most 20.

All clusters that are not occupied by files are considered to be free. A file can be read from the disk in the fastest way, if all its clusters are situated in the successive disk clusters in the natural order.Rotation of the disk with constant speed implies that various amounts of time are needed for accessing its clusters.

So, in our example team 1 is better than team 5 in the first contest with a difference of 3 places and worse in the second contest with a difference of only 1 place, therefore the overall rating of team 1 is higher than team 5's one. If the difference of the places is the same for both contests then that teams have the equal overall ratings. The latter is also true for the teams that performed equally in both contests.In our example only teams 1, 4, 5, and 9 participated twice. Team 1 has the highest rating, teams 5 and 9 with the equal rating follow, and team 4 has the lowest rating.For the teams that participated in one contest only the overall rating and their position in the resulting list cannot be always determined. They are included in the overall list (where the teams which participated twice already placed according to the rules above) if one of the following takes place:A)	If there is a team that participated in both contests and shared the place in one of the contests with the team in question then the latter team shares the overall rating with this team too (if there is more than one such team, then they all should have the same overall rating, otherwise the overall rating of the team in question cannot be determined).B)	If there is a position in the overall list (either at the beginning of the list, at the end of the list, or between some lines), such that before this position only the teams are located which performed better in the same contest as the team in question and after this position only the teams are located which performed worse in the same contest as the team in question, then the team in question occupies this position in the overall list. If more than one team claim to have the same position in the overall list, then their mutual order is defined by their places in their contests (look at the example below for details).            Teams       that participated in both contests                          Teams       that participated in one contest only                                                         3                              1                          10                              9       5                                                                                    19                              4                          20                                                         15       8                                                         31       18                                                         17 21                  ?Team 3 will occupy the first place in the overall list (rule B).?The positions of teams 6 and 7 cannot be determined.?Team 10 will share the overall rating with team 1 (rule A).?Team 20 will share the overall rating with team 4 (rule A).?Team 19 will occupy the position between teams 9, 5 and team 4 (rule B).?Teams 8, 15, 17, 18, 21, and 31 will finish the overall list (rule B).

False coin,http://poj.org/problem?id=1029, 1000MS, 65536K,"The ""Gold Bar""bank received information from reliable sources that in their last group of N coins exactly one coin is false and differs in weight from other coins (while all other coins are equal in weight). After the economic crisis they have only a simple balance available (like one in the picture). Using this balance, one is able to determine if the weight of objects in the left pan is less than, greater than, or equal to the weight of objects in the right pan.In order to detect the false coin the bank employees numbered all coins by the integers from 1 to N, thus assigning each coin a unique integer identifier. After that they began to weight various groups of coins by placing equal numbers of coins in the left pan and in the right pan. The identifiers of coins and the results of the weightings were carefully recorded.You are to write a program that will help the bank employees to determine the identifier of the false coin using the results of these weightings.","The first line of the input file contains two integers N and K, separated by spaces, where N is the number of coins (2', or '='.

The Same Game,http://poj.org/problem?id=1027, 1000MS, 10000K,"The game named ""Same"" is a single person game played on a 10 \Theta 15 board. Each square contains a ball colored red (R), green (G), or blue (B). Two balls belong to the same cluster if they have the same color, and one can be reached from another by following balls of the same color in the four directions up, down, left, and right. At each step of the game, the player chooses a ball whose cluster has at least two balls and removes all balls in the cluster from the board. Then, the board is ""compressed"" in two steps: 1. Shift the remaining balls in each column down to fill the empty spaces. The order of the balls in each column is preserved. 2. If a column becomes empty, shift the remaining columns to the left as far as possible. The order of the columns is preserved. For example, choosing the ball at the bottom left corner in the sub-board below causes: The objective of the game is to remove every ball from the board, and the game is over when every ball is removed or when every cluster has only one ball. The scoring of each game is as follows. The player starts with a score of 0. When a cluster of m balls is removed, the player's score increases by (m-2)^2 . A bonus of 1000 is given if every ball is removed at the end of the game. You suspect that a good strategy might be to choose the ball that gives the largest possible cluster at each step, and you want to test this strategy by writing a program to simulate games played using this strategy. If there are two or more balls to choose from, the program should choose the leftmost ball giving the largest cluster. If there is still a tie, it should choose the bottommost ball of these leftmost balls. ","You will be given a number of games in the input. The first line of input contains a positive integer giving the number of games to follow. The initial arrangement of the balls of each game is given one row at a time, from top to bottom. Each row contains 15 characters, each of which is one of ""R"", ""G"", or ""B"", specifying the colors of the balls in the row from left to right. A blank line precedes each game. ","For each game, print the game number, followed by a new line, followed by information about each move, followed by the final score. Each move should be printed in the format: Move x at (r,c): removed b balls of color C, got s points. where x is the move number, r and c are the row number and column number of the chosen ball, respectively. The rows are numbered from 1 to 10 from the bottom, and columns are numbered from 1 to 15 from the left. b is the number of balls in the cluster removed. C is one of ""R"", ""G"", or ""B"", indicating the color of the balls removed. s is the score for this move.

Surprisingly it is not a Public Key Cryptosystem, but their encoding and decoding is based on secret keys. They chose the secret key at their last meeting in Philadelphia on February 16th, 1996. They chose as a secret key a sequence of n distinct integers, a1 ; . . .; an, greater than zero and less or equal to n. The encoding is based on the following principle. The message is written down below the key, so that characters in the message and numbers in the key are correspondingly aligned. Character in the message at the position i is written in the encoded message at the position ai, where ai is the corresponding number in the key. And then the encoded message is encoded in the same way. This process is repeated k times. After kth encoding they exchange their message.The length of the message is always less or equal than n. If the message is shorter than n, then spaces are added to the end of the message to get the message with the length n.Help Alice and Bob and write program which reads the key and then a sequence of pairs consisting of k and message to be encoded k times and produces a list of encoded messages. ","The input file consists of several blocks.

Tester Program,http://poj.org/problem?id=1024, 1000MS, 10000K,"Tester ProgramFor this contest, we first designed the following problem (note that you do not have to solve it!):Another Wall in the MazeIn ACM/ICPC contests, you'll often see questions such as ""find the shortest path out of this maze."" Let's turn this on its head and ask ""given a path, find a maze for which the given path is the shortest path."" Our paths will run vertically and horizontally between the regularly spaced points of a rectangular grid. The problem is to compute a set of unit-length baffles (walls) separating grid points that forces the given path to be the unique shortest path from its starting point to the end point. To make things more interesting, we will require that there should be no redundant walls constructed in the sense that it should not be possible to remove any wall and still have the given path as the unique shortest path. In the following figure for example, consider the path through the 8 ? 5 grid on the left maze of the top row. The wall placements in the two mazes to its right (top row) make that path unique. The two mazes on the lower row are faulty.The path is not unique in the one on the left, and there are some redundant walls on the right.Input (of the original problem)The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The first line of each test case consists of two integers W and H (1 ≤ W, H ≤ 100) giving the width and height of the grid respectively. The second line of the test case contains a path. The path always starts in the lowerleft corner, (0, 0). It is specified as a string of U (up), D (down), L (left), and R (right) characters (with no embedded white space).

Packing Unit 4D Cubes,http://poj.org/problem?id=1022, 1000MS, 10000K,"We usually think that there are three geometric dimensions; the fourth dimension is usually time. However, the Association for Customizing Machines (ACM) has to deal with four geometrical dimensions for their strange customer EE3 who needs to pack four dimensional products into perpendicular parallelepipeds before shipping them to the newly emerged market niche just on the outskirts of the Milky Way.Each of EE3 products consists of a number of unit 4D cubes that are glued together at their faces. A face of a 4D cube is a 3D cube and each 4D cube has 8 such faces. The picture on the left shows a 4D cube projected into a plane with the four principal, orthogonal axes shown. It takes a bit of effort to stretch our imagination and see the faces of a 4D cube in such a projection. The pictures below try to illustrate how the two faces along each of the four axes are situated in 4D. Again, using just the planar projection it is not so easy to illustrate and takes some effort to see. But we have done a good job, didn't we?Each EE3 product to be packed consists of a number of unit 4D cubes that are glued together along their faces which are 3D cubes. Your job is simple: find the minimal volume measured in the number of unit 4D cubes of a perpendicular parallelepiped (a 4D box) into which the product can be packed before shipping.","The first line of the input file contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 10), the number of test cases, followed by input data for each test case describing one EE3 product. The first line of each test case is an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) which is the number of unit 4D cubes used in the product. Next, there are n lines, each describing one unit cube and contains 9 nonnegative integer numbers.The first number, a positive integer, is the unique identifier of a cube and the remaining 8 numbers give the identities of neighbors of the cube listed in the following order:?the first two numbers are identifiers of the cubes glued to the opposing sides of the given cube along the x1 axis as seen looking in the direction of the x1 axis;?the next two numbers as above but for the x2 axis;?the next two numbers as above but for the x3 axis;?the next two numbers as above but for the x4 axis;If a cube does not have a neighbor glued to one of its faces we use 0 instead of a cube identifier.The problem is that the employees of ACM may produce inconsistent descriptions of EE3 products. There are two sources of such inconsistencies:?A consistent description must be symmetric, i.e. if cube x is glued to cube y at some face then cube y must be glued to cube x at the corresponding face along the same axis. The following description is inconsistent:3 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 01 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0?Any description must describe a single solid, i.e. there must be only one component in the product. Thus the following is inconsistent:1 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 02 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 03 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 04 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0","There should be one output line per test case containing either the number of unit 4D cubes in the smallest 4D perpendicular parallelepiped oriented along the axes into which the product can be packed if the description is consistent, or the word Inconsistent, otherwise.","1

These three cycles are the physical, emotional, and intellectual cycles, and they have periods of lengths 23, 28, and 33 days, respectively. There is one peak in each period of a cycle. At the peak of a cycle, a person performs at his or her best in the corresponding field (physical, emotional or mental). For example, if it is the mental curve, thought processes will be sharper and concentration will be easier. Since the three cycles have different periods, the peaks of the three cycles generally occur at different times. We would like to determine when a triple peak occurs (the peaks of all three cycles occur in the same day) for any person. For each cycle, you will be given the number of days from the beginning of the current year at which one of its peaks (not necessarily the first) occurs. You will also be given a date expressed as the number of days from the beginning of the current year. You task is to determine the number of days from the given date to the next triple peak. The given date is not counted. For example, if the given date is 10 and the next triple peak occurs on day 12, the answer is 2, not 3.

One way to make a telephone number memorable is to have it spell a memorable word or phrase. For example, you can call the University of Waterloo by dialing the memorable TUT-GLOP. Sometimes only part of the number is used to spell a word. When you get back to your hotel tonight you can order a pizza from Gino's by dialing 310-GINO. Another way to make a telephone number memorable is to group the digits in a memorable way. You could order your pizza from Pizza Hut by calling their ``three tens'' number 3-10-10-10.The standard form of a telephone number is seven decimal digits with a hyphen between the third and fourth digits (e.g. 888-1200). The keypad of a phone supplies the mapping of letters to numbers, as follows:A, B, and C map to 2D, E, and F map to 3G, H, and I map to 4J, K, and L map to 5M, N, and O map to 6P, R, and S map to 7T, U, and V map to 8W, X, and Y map to 9There is no mapping for Q or Z. Hyphens are not dialed, and can be added and removed as necessary.

The first line of the input specifies the number of telephone numbers in the directory (up to 100,000) as a positive integer alone on the line. The remaining lines list the telephone numbers in the directory, with each number alone on a line. Each telephone number consists of a string composed of decimal digits, uppercase letters (excluding Q and Z) and hyphens. Exactly seven of the characters in the string will be digits or letters.","Generate a line of output for each telephone number that appears more than once in any form.
